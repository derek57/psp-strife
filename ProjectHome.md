What is PSP-Strife?:

PSP-Strife is a port of Rogue Entertainment's FPS game Strife to Sony's Playstation Portable as well as Playstation Vita, using the Playstation Vita's PSP emulator (emulating a CFW is required for that). By porting the Chocolate Strife engine, users are able to use this homebrew to play Strife on Sony's Playstation Portable and Playstation Vita.
