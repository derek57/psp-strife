- automap zoom is looping (doesn't stop when key is released)			(MOST LIKELY FIXED)
- automap player is walking even if follow mode is disabled			(MOST LIKELY FIXED)

- music randomly won't be playing						(MOST LIKELY FIXED)
(it still is a bit buggy (on a Vita (memory related)) but WAY better than that what was started with)

- hangups if game menu is active and button is pressed during screen wipe	(MOST LIKELY FIXED)

NOW:

-

LATER:

- side effect: weapon changes even if you hold 'forward' and then press left / right button
- bug: BOTH Strife Sharewares (v1.0 & v1.1 "Teasers" / "Demos") do not show any dialogues correctly
- bug: Strife Shareware v1.0 has really bad texture / patches issues (even crashes to 90 %)
- bug: when starting a completely new game, the game skill in the naming character menu is set +1
		(when saving normally it's the correct value (0))

MAYBE:

-

INFO:

- The dialogue text scripts of Strife's Teaser Releases v1.0 & v1.1 differ in the block size (1488
blocks) compared with the block size of the registered version (1516 blocks). That's most likely the
case why the dialogues of the Teasers won't work with this port.
