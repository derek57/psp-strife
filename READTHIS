- fixed bug: saving games (even presaving) wasn't possible while it was for the PC (PSP bug)
- fixed bug: during screen wipes the game hangs itself up when pressing a key at the menu (PSP bug)
- fixed bug: voices and music were randomly not playing (PSP bug)
- fixed bug: automap was auto-zooming on the PSP if trying to zoom while on automap (PSP bug)
- fixed bug: player moving around while follow mode is inactive and automap being explored (PSP bug)
- changed main menu structure (even added new features and had to do new graphics for sub-menues)
- hard coded controls (yet) because the bug for the key bindings has to be found first
- disabled multiplayer code (most likely no one needs it for the PSP at all - sorry) :-(
- disabled other unneeded program code that isn't required for the PSP



in order to run this game, you have to copy the strife1.wad (the name has to be lowercase) file
of the registered version of the game into the same folder where the EBOOT.PBP relies

you can either choice if you wanna have voices playing or not - just copy the voices.wad from the
registered version of the game into the same folder where the EBOOT.PBP relies (the filename must be
lowercase)
